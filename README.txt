The backend query system and frontend graphical user interface was coded in Python using
specific GUI tools and the sqlite3 library.

To run the application, open querygui.py and change the database path to the appropriate path of
the database file downloaded to ensure the sqlite3 command can connect to the database.

Then open command prompt and run main.py to run the application.
